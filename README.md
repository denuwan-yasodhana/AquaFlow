# 🎛️ PID Control Simulator

## 📚 Overview
This project is a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) Control Simulator developed using LabVIEW. The simulator allows users to visualize and fine-tune PID control parameters in real-time, providing a hands-on experience for understanding system dynamics and stability. Perfect for learning PID control concepts, testing controller settings, and simulating various systems.

## ✨ Features
- **Real-time Simulation**: Adjust PID parameters (P, I, D) and observe immediate changes in system behavior.
- **Dynamic Graphs**: Track the system's output, setpoint, and error values with real-time visualization.
- **Adjustable Parameters**: Easily modify Proportional, Integral, and Derivative terms.
  
## 💻 Requirements
- LabVIEW
- Basic knowledge of PID control systems
